## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned

This is the first time i created a webpage with a carousel. Thanks to Kevin Powell video on youtube I learnt a lot from his carousel video. I applied what I learnt to this challenge alongside my own javascript code to complete this challenge.

New javascripy syntaxes or method i picked include: 
- the Array.from method
- getBoundingClientRect method;

### Continued development

Frontend web dev journey has been chaotic and through yet fun. I'm becoming comfortable with javascript. 
Adding Interations to web pages is always fun.
